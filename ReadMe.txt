# Java Pomodoro Timer ‚è≥

A lightweight and installable **Pomodoro Timer** built in Java Swing to help you boost productivity and manage your work sessions efficiently.

I built this because my favorite web-based Pomodoro timers are sometimes unreachable, so I wanted a **reliable desktop version** I could use anytime.

## ‚ú® Features
- **Customizable sessions**: Set your own focus, short break, and long break durations.
